# Gofer Spec Summary

## EAI Platform Session Preflight

Before any Gofer stage/helper command does pipeline work:

1. Treat durable delivery as EAI Platform delivery by default, with Azure second
   and every other stack only by explicit exception.
2. Run `eai whoami` and confirm the EAI CLI is installed, the user is logged in,
   and an active tenant is visible.
3. If `eai` is missing, `eai whoami` fails, the token is expired, or no active
   tenant is available, stop and run `/gofer:eai-first-run` or ask the user to
   approve login/setup before continuing.
4. For EAI app delivery, do not continue into research, specification, planning,
   tasks, implementation, or validation until
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/eai-preflight.md` records login, tenant, template,
   app-readiness, and next-action evidence.
5. Do not write tokens, secrets, private tenant IDs, or local `.env` values into
   Gofer artifacts; record only product-safe readiness status and evidence.

## Token And Cost Policy

<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:start -->

Before spawning agents, calling tools, or loading large files:

1. Treat `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml` as the repo-owned source of
   truth for simple, medium, hard, and arbiter model routing. If it is missing,
   run `/gofer:bootstrap-workspace` before continuing.
2. Use the cheapest capable model first.
   - Claude: Haiku for scouting/extraction; Sonnet for normal implementation,
     synthesis, validation, and security; Opus for high-risk arbitration or
     release-critical failures.
   - Codex/OpenAI: GPT mini for simple coding; GPT nano only for
     locate/classify/summarize/mechanical work; GPT-5.3-Codex or flagship GPT
     for tool-heavy coding, architecture, and release-critical validation.
   - Gemini: Flash-Lite for cheap large-context scan/summarize; Flash for
     default research synthesis; Pro for large-context architecture or high-risk
     arbitration.
   - Copilot: prefer Auto for simple and default work; ask the user before
     choosing a paid/high-tier picker model for hard security, architecture, or
     release gates.
3. Keep raw tool output out of the main conversation context. Save stable
   findings to `.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md`, then work from
   summaries.
4. Use provider prompt/context caching only for stable, non-secret prefixes:
   Gofer scaffold, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Copilot instructions, constitution, repo map,
   stage contracts, and validation rubric.
5. Before continuing after large research, planning, implementation, or
   validation bursts, checkpoint the durable artifacts and compact/clear/resume
   context when the host supports it.
6. Escalate model tier only when a cheaper pass is low-confidence,
contradictory, security-sensitive, or blocking release quality.

## Business-Friendly Progress Contract

<!-- gofer:business-progress:start -->

Default user-facing updates must be concise, business-level, and easy to scan.
Keep the technical work rigorous in artifacts, tests, logs, and code, but do not
lead with implementation jargon unless the user asks for it.

1. Explain progress as what is being connected, changed, checked, or fixed and
   why it matters to the business outcome.
2. Use the running build map: create or update
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/build-map.md` from
   `.specify/templates/build-map-template.md` for application delivery, and
   refer to its plain-language areas in progress updates.
3. When there is a problem, translate it into business impact, current status,
   next action, and what input or approval is needed. Keep raw stack traces,
   command logs, IDs, and acronyms out of chat unless asked.
4. If the user asks for technical depth, provide it on request and point to the
   durable artifact that contains the evidence.
5. Prefer a compact update shape:
   - `Working on`: the build-map area or stakeholder outcome
   - `Why it matters`: user/business impact
   - `Status`: done, checking, fixing, blocked, or needs decision
6. Do not remove technical validation, security checks, EAI preflights, tests,
or loop evidence. This contract changes presentation, not engineering standards.
<!-- gofer:business-progress:end -->

Generate a business-friendly summary of the current feature and write it to
`.specify/specs/{feature}/spec-summary.md`.

Use this when a stakeholder or implementation team needs the plain-language
purpose, expected outcomes, and scope boundaries without diving into the full
spec.

When you run this helper:

1. Read the approved feature-local artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`,
   `contract-pack.md`, `quickstart.md`) and summarize only what is already in
   scope.
2. Keep the summary business-facing and humble. Do not turn it into a PRD or an
   issue-tracker export.
3. Write the artifact only to `.specify/specs/{feature}/spec-summary.md`.
4. If the target file already exists, replace it and prepend a regeneration note
   such as `<!-- regenerated at [ISO timestamp] -->`.
5. Include the minimum provenance schema:
   - `GeneratedAt`
   - `SourceCommandId`
   - `SourceInputs`
   - `OverwriteNoticeWhenApplicable`

The generated summary must contain these sections:

- `## Provenance`
- `## What`
- `## Why`
- `## Acceptance Criteria`
- `## Out of Scope`

Keep the content Gofer-owned. Do not copy upstream Matt Pocock skill text
verbatim.
