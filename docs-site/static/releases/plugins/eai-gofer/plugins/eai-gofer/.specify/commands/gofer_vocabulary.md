# Gofer Vocabulary

## Application Classification And EAI Preflight

Before any EAI CLI, login, tenant, template, or app-enrollment action:

1. Classify the request as **EAI app delivery** or **non-application work** using
   the signals in `.specify/commands/0_gofer_start.md`.
2. If the request is EAI app delivery or ambiguous, continue directly into the
   EAI app delivery path. Do not ask for confirmation just because app delivery
   is inferred.
3. If the request is clearly non-application work, confirm once before taking
   the non-app path:
   - **"This looks like non-app work, so I will skip EAI tenant/app setup and
     continue the Gofer research/docs path. Is that right?"**
4. If the user confirms non-app, record the decision in the feature discovery or
   context bundle, do not run `eai whoami`, `eai tenant select`, `eai init`, or
   `/gofer:eai-first-run`, and continue the appropriate non-app pipeline path.
5. If the user says it is app work, switch to EAI app delivery and run EAI app
   preflight.
6. For EAI app delivery, treat durable delivery as EAI Platform delivery by
   default, with Azure second and every other stack only by explicit exception.
7. For EAI app delivery, run `eai whoami` and confirm the EAI CLI is installed,
   the user is logged in, and an active tenant is visible.
8. If app-delivery readiness is missing, stop and run `/gofer:eai-first-run` or
   ask the user to approve login/setup before continuing.
9. For EAI app delivery, do not continue into research, specification, planning,
   tasks, implementation, or validation until
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/eai-preflight.md` records login, tenant, template,
   app-readiness, and next-action evidence.
10. Do not write tokens, secrets, private tenant IDs, or local `.env` values into
    Gofer artifacts; record only product-safe readiness status and evidence.

## Token And Cost Policy
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:start -->

Before spawning agents, calling tools, or loading large files:

1. Treat `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml` as the repo-owned source of truth for simple, medium, hard, and arbiter model routing. If it is missing, run `/gofer:bootstrap-workspace` before continuing.
2. Use the cheapest capable model first.
   - Claude: Haiku for scouting/extraction; Sonnet for normal implementation, synthesis, validation, and security; Opus for high-risk arbitration or release-critical failures.
   - Codex/OpenAI: GPT mini for simple coding; GPT nano only for locate/classify/summarize/mechanical work; GPT-5.3-Codex or flagship GPT for tool-heavy coding, architecture, and release-critical validation.
   - Gemini: Flash-Lite for cheap large-context scan/summarize; Flash for default research synthesis; Pro for large-context architecture or high-risk arbitration.
   - Copilot: prefer Auto for simple and default work; ask the user before choosing a paid/high-tier picker model for hard security, architecture, or release gates.
3. Keep raw tool output out of the main conversation context. Save stable findings to `.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md`, then work from summaries.
4. Use provider prompt/context caching only for stable, non-secret prefixes: Gofer scaffold, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Copilot instructions, constitution, repo map, stage contracts, and validation rubric.
5. Before continuing after large research, planning, implementation, or validation bursts, checkpoint the durable artifacts and compact/clear/resume context when the host supports it.
6. Escalate model tier only when a cheaper pass is low-confidence, contradictory, security-sensitive, or blocking release quality.

## Business-Friendly Progress Contract
<!-- gofer:business-progress:start -->

Default user-facing updates must be concise, business-level, and easy to scan.
Keep the technical work rigorous in artifacts, tests, logs, and code, but do
not lead with implementation jargon unless the user asks for it.

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English as the target writing standard for
all Gofer-authored chat, documents, commands, summaries, PR notes, error
guidance, and validation artifacts. ASD-STE100 is copyright and a trademark of
ASD; do not bundle the protected ASD dictionary and do not claim ASD
certification.

1. Explain progress as what is being connected, changed, checked, or fixed and
   why it matters to the business outcome.
2. Use the running build map: create or update
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/build-map.md` from
   `.specify/templates/build-map-template.md` for application delivery, and
   refer to its plain-language areas in progress updates.
3. When there is a problem, translate it into business impact, current status,
   next action, and what input or approval is needed. Keep raw stack traces,
   command logs, IDs, and acronyms out of chat unless asked.
4. If the user asks for technical depth, provide it on request and point to the
   durable artifact that contains the evidence.
5. Prefer a compact update shape:
   - `Working on`: the build-map area or stakeholder outcome
   - `Why it matters`: user/business impact
   - `Status`: done, checking, fixing, blocked, or needs decision
6. Use one action per instruction.
7. Keep instructions to 20 words or fewer where possible.
8. Use active voice unless the actor is unknown or not important.
9. Use simple verb forms: simple present, simple past, simple future,
   infinitive, or imperative.
10. Define acronyms on first use and use approved project terms.
11. Avoid idioms, marketing adjectives, vague praise, and hedging.
12. Use vertical lists for complex information and one topic per paragraph.
13. For errors, state what happened, why it matters, what to do next, and the
    exact safe command when one exists.
14. Do not remove technical validation, security checks, EAI preflights, tests,
   or loop evidence. This contract changes presentation, not engineering
   standards.
<!-- gofer:business-progress:end -->

Extract the feature's shared domain language into a canonical glossary and
write it to `.specify/specs/{feature}/glossary.md`.

Use this when research, specification, contracts, or implementation rely on
terms that need stable definitions across Claude, Copilot, Codex, and Gemini
surfaces.

When you run this helper:

1. Read the feature-local context that already exists (`research.md`, `spec.md`,
   `plan.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`) and ignore unrelated repository
   content.
2. Identify project-specific terms, acronyms, role names, workflow names, and
   overloaded words that need precise definitions.
3. Write the artifact only to `.specify/specs/{feature}/glossary.md`. Never
   write to repo root or any provider-specific surface directory.
4. If the target file already exists, replace it and prepend a regeneration note
   such as `<!-- regenerated at [ISO timestamp] -->`.
5. Include the minimum provenance schema:
   - `GeneratedAt`
   - `SourceCommandId`
   - `SourceInputs`
   - `OverwriteNoticeWhenApplicable`

The generated glossary must contain these sections:

- `## Provenance`
- `## Term Entries`
- `## Definitions`
- `## Source Artifacts`

Keep the content Gofer-owned and concise. Do not copy upstream Matt Pocock
skill text verbatim.
