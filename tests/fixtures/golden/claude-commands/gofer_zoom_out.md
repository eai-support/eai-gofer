# Gofer Zoom Out

## Continuation And Stop Contract
<!-- gofer:continuation:start -->

1. Preserve the requested scope and mode, including read-only, plan-only, research-only and MVP work. Keep the full applicable pipeline, stage functions, artifacts, reviews and validation; do not expand an MVP into an unapproved release.
2. After a stage's required evidence is complete, read and follow the next internal file in .specify/commands/ in the same conversation. Do not require a numbered command or a host-specific skill dispatcher. Optional helpers remain optional; maintenance and control commands do not start delivery work.
3. After explicit business-specification approval, continue routine planning, tasks, implementation and validation within that approved scope. Record the approval source and scope; missing or ambiguous approval is not approval. A proposal or generated status is not user consent.
4. Preserve any explicit plan/task approval requirement unless it is already satisfied by recorded user approval covering that work. Rejected, revoked, changed or unclear approval requires a pause. Never invent approvedBy, approvedAt or a new approval event when reusing an existing approval.
5. Pause for material scope, security, cost, deployment, destructive or protected files/boundary changes and any outstanding user gate. Business approval does not authorize publishing, spending, external changes or bypassing host permissions. Complete safe authorized work without bypassing the blocked gate.
6. A tool proposal is not execution. If host consent is required, wait for it. After the tool result or approved proposal returns, inspect the result and resume the next authorized action within approved scope; do not end with only a plan or a proposed tool call. A denied tool or unavailable capability must not be bypassed through another host or CLI.
7. Use the current agent's available native tools. Optional Gofer/MCP tools are conveniences, not prerequisites. If the current agent lacks a required capability, report that limitation and the safe next action; do not pretend a handoff button transfers control automatically.
8. Stop after research only when research-only work was requested, the user paused, or a real gate blocks progress. Otherwise continue to specification. At validation, report completion only when the requested scope's required evidence passes; failures remain unfinished work.
9. Respect budget, context and retry limits from the existing loop contract. Repair safe within-scope failures only within those limits. Preserve a checkpoint before an orderly context stop; resume by reading its recorded stage and rechecking scope, approvals and evidence. Never claim an abrupt host termination was handled.
10. Report concise Progress during work. At every controlled stop, report Progress, Stop reason and Next action, including the exact missing input or approval and unfinished work. Reasons are requested scope complete, user pause, approval required, material change, missing capability/access, validation blocked, or budget/context/retry limit. Stage completion alone is not pipeline completion.

## MVP Capability-Based Validation

Use `.specify/references/mvp-capability-validation.md` as the source of
truth. Validate the work that the active feature specification requires now.
Do not apply later delivery requirements to an early MVP.

1. Create `.specify/specs/{feature}/` before app or operator-tool source work.
2. Keep `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `traceability.md`, and the validation scope aligned.
3. Mark each relevant capability as `not_applicable`, `planned`, `implemented`, `verified`, or `blocked`.
4. Require evidence only for an implemented capability or a capability required by the current delivery decision.
5. Treat `run.sh`, `run.bat`, and `run.ps1` as launch evidence only. They do not prove authentication, sessions, EAI access, or deployment readiness.
6. For a user-facing change, store the local HTTP check, screenshot, and review outcome in the feature validation report.
7. If browser validation is blocked, mark that user journey `unverified`. Do not call it complete.
8. If the user changes scope, update the feature artifacts before continuing. Explain what changed, what remains valid, and what now needs evidence.
9. Use truthful completion language. For example: `The server runs. Authentication is not in the current MVP scope.`
10. When the feature claims a release or deployed outcome, create `release-capability-ledger.md` from `.specify/templates/release-capability-ledger-template.md`.
11. Do not report a release complete or score 100% when a required capability is missing from traceability, remains on an open PR, is absent from the release branch, or lacks required deployed evidence.

## Application Classification And EAI Preflight

Before any EAI CLI, login, tenant, template, or app-enrollment action:

1. Classify the request as **EAI app delivery** or **non-application work** using the application signals in `.specify/commands/0_gofer_start.md`.
2. Create `.specify/specs/{feature}/` and record the active delivery scope before app or operator-tool source work.
3. If the request is clearly non-app work, confirm once: **"This looks like non-app work, so I will skip EAI tenant/app setup and continue the Gofer research/docs path. Is that right?"**
4. If the user confirms non-app, record the decision and mark app-only capabilities `not_applicable`. Do not run `eai whoami`, `eai tenant select`, `eai init`, or `/gofer:eai-first-run`.
5. For local MVP app work, validate the implemented user journey, repo runner, and preview evidence. Do not require EAI setup, authentication, or deployment when the active specification does not require them.
6. When the feature uses EAI Platform services, requires a tenant, or prepares deployment, run `eai whoami` and record the EAI readiness evidence in `eai-preflight.md`.
7. When the feature creates, changes, or validates an EAI Platform app integration, run `node .specify/scripts/node/eai-app-template-readiness.mjs --root . --json`. A missing checker or status other than `ready` blocks that EAI capability. It does not block unrelated local MVP work.
8. When authentication is implemented or required, validate provider, callback, sign-in, session, first protected API call, and safe denied access.
9. When deployment is requested or claimed, require the relevant EAI template, security, configuration, and deployment evidence before completion.
10. For durable app delivery, use EAI Platform first, Azure second, and every other stack only by explicit exception.
11. If the user changes scope, update `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `traceability.md`, and validation scope before continuing. Explain the business effect and evidence change.
12. Do not accept copied marker files, partial scaffolds, or custom templates as readiness evidence for an EAI capability.
13. Do not write tokens, secrets, private tenant IDs, or local `.env` values into Gofer artifacts; record only product-safe readiness status and evidence.

## Token And Cost Policy
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:start -->

Before spawning agents, calling tools, or loading large files:

1. Treat `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml` as the repo-owned source of truth for simple, medium, hard, and arbiter model routing. If it is missing, run `/gofer:bootstrap-workspace` before continuing.
2. Use the cheapest capable model first.
   - Claude: Haiku for scouting/extraction; Sonnet for normal implementation, synthesis, validation, and security; Opus for high-risk arbitration or release-critical failures.
   - Codex/OpenAI: GPT mini for simple coding; GPT nano only for locate/classify/summarize/mechanical work; GPT-5.3-Codex or flagship GPT for tool-heavy coding, architecture, and release-critical validation.
   - Gemini: Flash-Lite for cheap large-context scan/summarize; Flash for default research synthesis; Pro for large-context architecture or high-risk arbitration.
   - Copilot: prefer Auto for simple and default work; ask the user before choosing a paid/high-tier picker model for hard security, architecture, or release gates.
3. Keep raw tool output out of the main conversation context. Save stable findings to `.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md`, then work from summaries.
4. Use provider prompt/context caching only for stable, non-secret prefixes: Gofer scaffold, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Copilot instructions, constitution, repo map, stage contracts, and validation rubric.
5. Before continuing after large research, planning, implementation, or validation bursts, checkpoint the durable artifacts and compact/clear/resume context when the host supports it.
6. Escalate model tier only when a cheaper pass is low-confidence, contradictory, security-sensitive, or blocking release quality.
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:end -->

## Business-Friendly Progress Contract
<!-- gofer:business-progress:start -->

Default user-facing updates must be concise, business-level, and easy to scan.
Keep the technical work rigorous in artifacts, tests, logs, and code, but do
not lead with implementation jargon unless the user asks for it.

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English as the target writing standard for
all Gofer-authored chat, documents, commands, summaries, PR notes, error
guidance, and validation artifacts. ASD-STE100 is copyright and a trademark of
ASD; do not bundle the protected ASD dictionary and do not claim ASD
certification.

1. Explain progress as what is being connected, changed, checked, or fixed and
   why it matters to the business outcome.
2. Use the running build map: create or update
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/build-map.md` from
   `.specify/templates/build-map-template.md` for application delivery, and
   refer to its plain-language areas in progress updates.
3. When there is a problem, translate it into business impact, current status,
   next action, and what input or approval is needed. Keep raw stack traces,
   command logs, IDs, and acronyms out of chat unless asked.
4. If the user asks for technical depth, provide it on request and point to the
   durable artifact that contains the evidence.
5. Prefer a compact update shape:
   - `Working on`: the build-map area or stakeholder outcome
   - `Why it matters`: user/business impact
   - `Status`: done, checking, fixing, blocked, or needs decision
6. Use one action per instruction.
7. Keep instructions to 20 words or fewer where possible.
8. Use active voice unless the actor is unknown or not important.
9. Use simple verb forms: simple present, simple past, simple future,
   infinitive, or imperative.
10. Define acronyms on first use and use approved project terms.
11. Avoid idioms, marketing adjectives, vague praise, and hedging.
12. Use vertical lists for complex information and one topic per paragraph.
13. For errors, state what happened, why it matters, what to do next, and the
    exact safe command when one exists.
14. Do not remove technical validation, security checks, EAI preflights, tests,
   or loop evidence. This contract changes presentation, not engineering
   standards.
15. Before each user-facing reply, check that it leads with the business effect,
    uses concise simple language, and includes only useful technical detail.
16. If any check fails, rewrite the reply before sending it.
<!-- gofer:business-progress:end -->

Expand the current feature into its surrounding system context and write the
result to `.specify/specs/{feature}/zoom-out-report.md`.

Use this helper when the feature needs broader architectural framing: upstream
dependencies, downstream consumers, or cross-cutting risks that are easy to
miss inside a narrow task view.

When you run this helper:

1. Read the approved feature-local artifacts and identify the current boundary
   being changed.
2. Map the upstream inputs, downstream consumers, and cross-cutting impacts that
   materially affect the feature.
3. Keep the output feature-local and architecture-focused.
4. Write the artifact only to
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/zoom-out-report.md`.
5. If the target file already exists, replace it and prepend a regeneration note
   such as `<!-- regenerated at [ISO timestamp] -->`.
6. Include the minimum provenance schema:
   - `GeneratedAt`
   - `SourceCommandId`
   - `SourceInputs`
   - `OverwriteNoticeWhenApplicable`

The generated zoom-out report must contain these sections:

- `## Provenance`
- `## Current Boundary`
- `## Upstream/Downstream`
- `## Cross-Cutting Impact`

Keep the content Gofer-owned. Do not copy upstream Matt Pocock skill text
verbatim.

## App Preview Runner Contract
<!-- gofer:app-preview-runner:start -->

For EAI app delivery, every UI preview must use the repo runner when it exists.

1. Use `./run.sh dev 3001` on macOS, Linux, and GitHub Codespaces.
2. Use `run.bat dev 3001` on Windows.
3. Use a different port only when the feature notes record the reason.
4. Restart only this app. Before stopping a process, verify its exact checkout, process ID, start time and command, then recheck immediately before stopping it. Never stop another app, an unknown process, or every process on a port. If ownership is uncertain, leave it running and ask the user. Inspect older runners before use; do not run one that kills by port alone.
5. Do not use direct `npm run dev`, `next dev`, or package-manager preview commands when `run.sh`, `run.bat`, or `run.ps1` exists.
6. After every UI-facing change, run:
   - `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-ui-preview.mjs --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --command "./run.sh dev 3001" --open auto --screenshot --change "<change summary>"`
7. On Windows, use:
   - `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-ui-preview.mjs --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --command "run.bat dev 3001" --open auto --screenshot --change "<change summary>"`
8. If the runner is missing in an EAI app template repo, refresh the template before preview work continues.
9. Check the exact preview page and the current implemented user journey after each change. A running process, open browser, screenshot alone, error page or dry run is not proof that it works. Say ready to view only after those checks pass. Otherwise explain what is unchecked or failing; do not claim readiness. Record fresh browser and test evidence. Local MVP checks cover only implemented behaviour; do not add future auth or deployment gates. Keep showing clearly labelled drafts without adding approval stops.
<!-- gofer:app-preview-runner:end -->

## Local Settings Cleanup Contract
<!-- gofer:local-settings-cleanup:start -->

After any Gofer install, update, release refresh, or workspace bootstrap:

1. Archive stale Gofer command and skill entries before continuing.
2. Prefer the repo helper:
   - `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json`
3. If the repo helper is missing, use the stable plugin bundle helper:
   - macOS/Linux: `node ~/plugins/eai-gofer/.specify/scripts/node/gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json`
   - Windows: `node %USERPROFILE%\plugins\eai-gofer\.specify\scripts\node\gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json`
4. This cleanup covers old Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Grok, VS Code, desktop, and CLI command surfaces.
5. Do not remove the current public `eai` entrypoint.
6. Ask the user to refresh or restart the host command picker only after cleanup completes.
