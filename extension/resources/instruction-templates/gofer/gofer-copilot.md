This project uses Gofer for spec-driven development. In GitHub Copilot Chat, run
`#0_gofer_start` to start the core pipeline: business scenario -> research ->
specify -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> validate.

Key prompts: `#1_gofer_research`, `#2_gofer_specify`, `#3_gofer_plan`,
`#4_gofer_tasks`, `#5_gofer_implement`, `#6_gofer_validate`. `#6_gofer_validate`
is the terminal quality gate and includes the final engineering review loop. Use
`#7_gofer_save` for checkpoints and `#8_gofer_branding` for branded
document/deck templates. Artifacts in `.specify/specs/{feature}/`.
